Overview
========

This project was created mostly for practice.  It's done with with my take
on how a Wiki should work.

That being said...

What is a wiki?
---------------

    A wiki is a website that uses wiki software, allowing the easy creation and editing of any number of interlinked Web pages, using a simplified markup language or a WYSIWYG text editor, within the browser.  Wikis are often used to create collaborative websites, to power community websites, and for note taking.  `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki>`_

Basic Concepts
--------------

From the definition above we know that a wiki must:

* be easy
* be unbounded (as many/little pages as required)
* use simplified markup or WYSIWYG
* foster collaboration
